# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[security@template.com]**. You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

## Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated dependency vulnerability scanning via GitHub Security Advisories
- **Code Scanning**: Static analysis security testing (SAST) via CodeQL
- **Supply Chain Security**: Package integrity verification and provenance tracking
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege for all integrations and deployments
