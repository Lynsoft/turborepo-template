## Using This Template

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 10.14.0+ (recommended package manager)

### Quick Start

1. **Use this template** on GitHub or clone it:
```bash
git clone <template-repository-url>
cd your-project-name
```

2. **Update project details**:
   - Change the `name` in `package.json`
   - Update the repository URL in `package.json`
   - Modify package names from `@repo/*` to `@your-project/*`

3. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pnpm install
```

4. **Set up development environment**:
```bash
pnpm hooks:install
```

5. **Start building your project**:
```bash
# Create your first app
pnpm gen:app

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

### Development Tools

This Turborepo includes modern development tools:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for fast linting and formatting
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling
- [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) for git hooks
- [Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) for automated releases

### Build

To build all packages, run:

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Build specific package
pnpm build --filter=@holeswing/ui
```

### Development

To start development mode:

```bash
# Start development for all packages
pnpm dev

# Start development for specific package
pnpm dev --filter=@holeswing/ui
```

### Template Customization

After using this template, customize it for your project:

1. **Update Package Names**: Change `@repo/*` to `@your-project/*` in:
   - `packages/*/package.json`
   - Import statements throughout the codebase

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Update database and service configurations

3. **Generate Applications**:
```bash
# Create a new app (Next.js, Vite, etc.)
pnpm gen:app

# Create a new package
pnpm gen:package
```

4. **Update Repository Settings**:
   - Configure GitHub repository URL
   - Set up CI/CD secrets if needed
   - Enable GitHub Actions for automated releases

### Code Quality

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for fast linting and formatting of TypeScript, JavaScript, JSX/TSX, and JSON files.

#### Available Commands

```bash
# Format all files
pnpm run format

# Lint and auto-fix
pnpm run lint:fix

# Check formatting and linting (no fixes)
pnpm run check

# Check and auto-fix formatting and linting
pnpm run check:fix
```

#### Features

- **Fast Performance**: Biome is significantly faster than ESLint + Prettier
- **Multi-Language Support**: Native support for TypeScript, JavaScript, JSX/TSX, and JSON
- **TailwindCSS Class Sorting**: Automatically sorts TailwindCSS classes
- **Import Sorting**: Organizes imports automatically
- **Consistent Formatting**: Enforces consistent code style across the monorepo
- **All-in-One Tool**: Single tool for linting, formatting, and import organization

#### Configuration

Biome is configured via `biome.json` at the root of the monorepo. The configuration includes:

- Linting rules for TypeScript, React, and general JavaScript
- Formatting rules with 2-space indentation and 80-character line width
- TailwindCSS class sorting for better maintainability
- Import organization and sorting
- Special overrides for configuration files and TypeScript declaration files

### Git Hooks with Lefthook

This project uses [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) to automatically run code quality checks before commits and pushes, ensuring consistent code quality across the team.

#### What Lefthook Does

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automatically format and lint staged files before each commit
- **Pre-push hooks**: Run full builds and type checks before pushing to remote
- **Post-checkout/merge hooks**: Automatically install dependencies when package files change

#### Available Hook Commands

```bash
# Install git hooks (run once after cloning)
pnpm hooks:install

# Uninstall git hooks
pnpm hooks:uninstall

# Manually run pre-commit checks
pnpm hooks:test

# Run any hook manually
pnpm hooks:run <hook-name>
```

#### Pre-commit Checks

When you commit, Lefthook automatically runs:

1. **Biome Check**: Formats and lints staged files with auto-fix
2. **TypeScript Check**: Validates type safety (only if TypeScript files are staged)

#### Pre-push Checks

Before pushing to remote, Lefthook runs:

1. **Build Check**: Ensures all packages build successfully
2. **Full Type Check**: Validates TypeScript across all workspaces

#### Configuration

Lefthook is configured via `lefthook.yml` at the root. The configuration is optimized for:

- **Performance**: Only runs checks on staged files when possible
- **Turborepo Integration**: Uses Turbo commands for cross-workspace operations
- **Auto-fixing**: Automatically fixes formatting and linting issues
- **Monorepo Support**: Handles pnpm workspace dependencies correctly

#### First-time Setup

After cloning the repository, run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm hooks:install
```

The hooks will then automatically run on every commit and push.

### Automated Release Workflow

This project includes a complete automated release workflow using Commitlint, Semantic Release, and GitHub Actions.

#### Key Features

- **Conventional Commits**: Enforced commit message format for automated versioning
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automatic version bumping based on commit types
- **Changelog Generation**: Automated changelog creation from commit messages
- **GitHub Releases**: Automatic GitHub releases with build artifacts
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive testing and validation before releases

# Interactive commit with prompts
pnpm commit

# Validate commit message format
pnpm commitlint
